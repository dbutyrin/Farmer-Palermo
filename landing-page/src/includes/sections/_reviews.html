            Mr Farmer worked with me on my appeal to the VA for spousal benefits. I had begun the process about 6 1/2 years prior to hearing about the Veterans clinic @ John Marshall Law School.

            Ed was very pleasant & helpful to me & the success of my appeal.         </article>

            Ed helped me receive VA compensation in a very reasonable time, especially since it was one of the slowest processing times in history. When he left the prior law firm he worked, no one else would help me further. Thanks for a good job Ed.        </article>
